            Geoda Green Suppliers Ltd. is a comapny that is dedicated to providing farmers with high quality, durable greenhouses and farming materials that suit different climatic conditions both in Kenya and many African countries.

            Through services provided, farmers who over the years were dependant on common farming methods, have discovered that they can farm on a relatively small piece of land controlled under a greenhouse and give them higher returns.This therefore has helped both large and small scale farmers curb frequemt farming challenges hence increasing farm produce.
